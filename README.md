Vanilla Pac-Man javaScript Game

Background:
The main goals of this project was to review vanilla JS, HTML and CSS concepts learned, experiment with moving game characters on screen, and learn how to upload projects onto Github.

Instructions:
To play the game, press the "Start" button at the bottom of the screen. The game will start after the 3-second countdown timer. Control Pac-Man's movement with your keyboard arrow keys.

Game Over if Pac-Man loses a life if it comes into contact with a Ghost (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde). However, the four Power-Ups scattered around the map can "scare" the Ghosts for 10 seconds; Pac-Man can "eat" ghosts when they are scared.

To win the game, Pac-Man needs to "eat" all the Pac-Dots around the map.

Pac-Dot = 10 points
Power-Up = 50 points
Scared-Ghost = 200 points

Good luck!

Additional notes:
Some key features of this game Pac-Man and Ghosts moving around the grid while avoiding walls, Inky and Clyde having "basic" movement function to move randomly around the map, Blinky and Pinky having "smart" movement function to triangulate on Pac-Man's position.
